# NoSQL-Challenge: UK Food Hygiene Ratings üç¥

## Overview

This project leverages **MongoDB** and **Python** to analyze food hygiene data from the UK Food Standards Agency. It involves setting up a NoSQL database, updating data, and performing exploratory analysis to provide insights for the food magazine **Eat Safe, Love**. The data includes ratings for establishments across the UK, helping the magazine decide where to focus future articles.

## Deliverables

### Part 1: Database Setup

- Import the `establishments.json` file into MongoDB, creating a database named `uk_food` and a collection named `establishments`.
- Verify successful data import by:
  - Listing all databases and collections in MongoDB.
  - Querying a sample document from the `establishments` collection.
- Prepare the collection for analysis by assigning it to a variable.

### Part 2: Update the Database

- **Add a new restaurant**: Include information for a newly opened halal restaurant, "Penang Flavours," in Greenwich.
- **Update BusinessTypeID**: Find and assign the correct `BusinessTypeID` for "Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen."
- **Remove specific data**: Delete all records associated with the "Dover Local Authority."
- **Data cleaning**:
  - Convert latitude and longitude fields from strings to decimal numbers.
  - Convert `RatingValue` fields to integers.

### Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

Answer the following questions using MongoDB queries and Python:

1. **Hygiene Score of 20**:
   - Find establishments with a hygiene score of 20.
2. **Highly Rated Establishments in London**:
   - Identify establishments in London with a `RatingValue` greater than or equal to 4.
3. **Top 5 Establishments Near "Penang Flavours"**:
   - Find the top 5 establishments with a `RatingValue` of 5, sorted by hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant.
4. **Hygiene Score Analysis by Local Authority**:
   - Determine the number of establishments in each local authority with a hygiene score of 0. Sort the results in descending order and display the top 10.

## Insights and Results

- **Hygiene Score Distribution**: Identify patterns in hygiene scores to highlight clean and problematic establishments.
- **Highly Rated Locations**: Highlight the best-rated establishments in key areas like London.
- **Proximity-Based Analysis**: Compare hygiene ratings of establishments near "Penang Flavours."
- **Local Authority Insights**: Showcase authorities with the highest number of poorly rated establishments.
